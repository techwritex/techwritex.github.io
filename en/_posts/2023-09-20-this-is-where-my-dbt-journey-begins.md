Here is my little story.

I've been working as a Business Intelligence Consultant (Developer) for about 14 years. My primary focus is data warehousing and data analytics.

I always thought I was a data guy. However, this is not entirely true.

***

My experience primarily includes working with on-premise SAP data solutions. So, I'm an SAP data guy, mainly.

Sometimes, I tried to follow innovations in the Data world. But it was just my curiosity. There was no way to implement a Modern Data Stack to my current job because of some reasons.
Fortunately for me, several meetings with interesting people showed me that my knowledge about data solutions was outdated.

After I came across an interesting quote from the 35th president of the United States, I decided not to waste my time and dive into the Modern Data World.

> "Time and the world do not stand still. Change is the law of life." ― John F. Kennedy

Also, I remembered one more interesting quote from one of my favorite books that inspired me as well.

> "My dear, here we must run as fast as we can, just to stay in place. And if you wish to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that." ― Lewis Carroll, Alice in Wonderland

Even though I have not involved in any real project with a Modern Data Stack, I have tried to get my hands dirty using labs and exercises from different courses or certification trainings.

After I had passed my *AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty exam*, I started to study dbt which stands for data build tool. This is an incredible tool from dbt Labs for data analysts and data engineers to transform data in their data warehouses.

Anyway, my dbt journey began from the dbt Fundamentals course. Well, [I've just successfully passed](https://www.credential.net/30135104-44b3-4b7c-8dfb-0f08cb794c41) the course.

So, my dbt journey continues..

Do you want to improve your writing skills for your job, education or just for fun? Actually, it doesn’t matter what your reasons are. 

There are number of ways to achieve the goal. 

For instance, you can take some writing courses or classes to improve your written communication. Also, you can buy books about writing. Finally, you can combine both ways and find the others.

However, the main idea of all these ways is the following: *you have to do written exercises systematically*.

Almost all great and famous writers tell us about regular written exercises.

As proof, one of my favorite writers, William Zinsser, confirms the idea. In his *On Writing Well* he says, “The only way to learn to write is to force yourself to produce a certain number of words on a regular basis.”

At the same time, it’s not so easy. Especially at the begging of the writing process.

I know it’s hard to push yourself to write some sentences or even words on a piece of paper.

Fortunately, there is one easy exercise - I’d say the easiest one - to improve your writing skills. It is *social media comments*. Yes, just write comments!

Every day we read our social media feeds and press buttons such as *like*, *support*, *insightful*, etc.

*Don’t do that without a comment* if you want to improve your writing skills! 

Did you like an article or an image? Type some sentences - even one short sentence - below a content interesting to you. Why did you like it? Why did it amaze you? 

According to Facebook usage statistics, in a month, the average user [likes 10 posts](https://www.slideshare.net/DataReportal/digital-2018-q4-global-digital-statshot-october-2018-v2). So, 10 *likes* could be converted to 10 sentences (minimum). Yes, it is no so many. But count *your* daily likes and estimate number of potential sentences. It could be more than 10. 

Of course comments is not the only writing exercise. But make a habit to comment a content you like. It will help you to take a step forward to improve your writing skills without effort.
